Hi everyone! Thanks for stopping by on my blog. I really appreciate you taking your time out to read it. 
Since this is the first post, I would like to give you a background as to how I got to this blog.

At the time of starting to build this, I was in transition phase of my career - from software engineer to quant researcher. 
But since I have spent many years as a software engineer, I didn't want to lose ground on those set of skills. 
I thought of building a blog as a personal project, which would be useful as sort-of-a-diary, and also improve my writing skills (*highly needed as evident from this poorly written post*).
For new viewers I recommend checking out this blog on a desktop than mobile, since it looks a lot better on that (*weird flex, but okay!*)

With that said, I want to bring your attention to something really important to the viewers. 
Certain posts on this website could be unnerving to the readers. 
Please note that these articles are a representation of my own personal views. 
I'll try my best to not target them towards any individual or a group. 
However, if you still feel hurt, please refrain yourself from bothering me.

Thank you for reading this, and keep an eye out for upcoming posts. But before ending, I want to leave a lame yet interesting reference for why I chose this date for publishing the first post: 

> Remember, remember!\
> The fifth of November,\
> The Gunpowder treason and plot;\
> I know of no reason\
> Why the Gunpowder treason\
> Should ever be forgot!

P.S. A big thanks to [Thiago Rossner](https://github.com/thiagorossener) for providing the template for this website.
