A﻿n year ago, I took a trip to the national parks of Utah, US. These are colloquially called The Mighty 5, a group of 5 national parks hugging the borders of Southern Utah with parts of them in Arizona, and Nevada as well. These national parks, in the order of my visit, are - Canyonlands, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Zion National Park.

A﻿s a traveller, I try to make it a brand new experience for me. That means, I don't like to go online & see the pictures of the place where I'm gonna travel to. Just enough to decide where to go and stay. That way, there are no expectations in my head about the place beforehand, consequently not leaving much room for disappointment either (just in case). For the same reason, I don't like to watch trailers of movies, but that's a story for another day lol. 

T﻿his trip was made even better by this habit of mine. The first two national parks I visited, was with a childhood friend of mine. He made all the travel arrangements, and saving me from seeing even a single photo of this place online beforehand. So when you scroll through these photos, imagine that one day you wake up and you're taken to this beautiful place, that you have never ever seen before. And cherry on top, it was my birthday when I went there.

This was only an intro to the series of posts﻿, most likely one for each national park. I'll soon leave some photos here to give you a hang of what's coming next. I promise you it's only going to get better from here!
