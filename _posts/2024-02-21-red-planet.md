Aï»¿n year ago, I took a trip to the national parks of Utah, US. These are colloquially called The Mighty 5, a group of 5 national parks hugging the borders of Southern Utah with parts of them in Arizona, and Nevada as well. These national parks, in the order of my visit, are - Canyonlands, Arches National Park, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Zion National Park.
