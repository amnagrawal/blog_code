  - text: "A creative adult is the child who survived"
  - text: "Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day whispering, 'I will try again tomorrow'"
  - text: "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"
  - text: "We need to stare at the face of reality, and not bury our head in sand, shouting slogans about our past greatness (real or imagined)"
  - text: "Nature wants 5 of your 7 children dead. It wants you dead by 50. Everything better than that is brought to you by science and technology"
