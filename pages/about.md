# About

Hi, this is your friendly bear. Glad you could take your time out to read this. In this blog I would be sharing all 
kinds of random stuff, including my life experiences, travel stories and sometimes important skill-building stuff. 

With time I hope to reach out to a good audience. I promise you won't need an AdBlocker on this website. I wanted to build 
this website only to share my views about events of my life. It is possible that some of these opinions might be unnerving to some readers. 
Please refrain from messaging me if that's the case with you. However, I am always open to new blog ideas.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts on this blog, and if you do please help me gain more viewership by sharing to as 
many people. You can reach me through the contact page on my blog or by clicking on one of the social media links below.
